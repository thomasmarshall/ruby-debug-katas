# ruby-debug-katas

A collection of short exercises to get more comfortable using [ruby/debug](https://github.com/ruby/debug).

## Usage

Run an exercise using ruby:

```sh
$ ruby exercises/01_quit.rb
```

This will drop directly into a debugger. Follow the instructions in the comments to learn the debug commands one at a time. Later exercises will use commands learned in earlier ones, so doing them in order is recommended.

## Status

Currently the exercises only cover basic control flow, breakpoint, and evaluation commands, but I plan to add more as I learn and practice myself. I'd also like to add more realistic debugging scenarios alongside the instructional exercises.
