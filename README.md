# ruby-debug-katas

A collection of short exercises to get more comfortable using [ruby/debug](https://github.com/ruby/debug).

## Usage

Run an exercise using ruby:

```sh
$ ruby exercises/01_quit.rb
```

This will drop directly into a debugger. Follow the instructions in the comments to learn the debug commands one at a time. Later exercises will use commands learned in earlier ones, so doing them in order is recommended.
